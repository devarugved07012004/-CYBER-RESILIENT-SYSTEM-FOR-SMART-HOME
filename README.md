# CYBER-RESILIENT-SYSTEM-FOR-SMART-HOME

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT)devices in smart homes has introduced significant security challenges, making advanced intrusion detection systems(IDS) essential for itigating potential threats. In this study,proposed a comprehensive framework for designing andimplementing an IDS specifically tailored for IoT-enabledsmart homes. The approach integrates LightGBM (LGBM)for attack detection and employs feature reduction techniquesto enhance model performance and efficiency. This evaluated IDS using both IoT datasets and tested threefeature reduction methods: Recursive Feature Elimination(RFE), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and LinearDiscriminant Analysis (LDA). The results show that RFE provided the best balance of detection accuracy andcomputational efficiency. The model effectively identified Mirai and Gafgyt attacks, achieving high accuracy rates of 99% on the datasets. Compared to previous systems, modeldemonstrated superior performance with reducedcomputational overhead, enhancing both detection accuracy and operational efficiency. Privacy and securityconsiderations were carefully addressed throughout the design process to ensure user data protection and compliance with relevant regulations. Future work will focus onexpanding the modelâ€™s capability to detect a broader range ofattacks, improving scalability, and integrating advanced IoTtechnologies to further refine the IDS framework.
